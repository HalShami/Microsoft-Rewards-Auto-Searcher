This was my first applicable python project. It helped me get my searches in faster. Decided to upload cuz why not. 
GUI version may be introduced later; however, for the time being make sure you have python 3.0 or higher, have all the required libraries installed (time, selenium, selenium chrome webdriver, random, string), have all 3 files in the same directory, and change the values in the credentials script.
Once those steps are complete you may run the autoSearch1 script once a day to easily claim your daily points.
